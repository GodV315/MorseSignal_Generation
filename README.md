# MorseSignal_Generation
this project used for Morse signal detection task in spectrogram
Morse signals are simulated with different SNR, code speed, and frequency jitter.
Morse signals are added with background signal in ./data
start and stop time and frequency locations are saved as annotations for detection task.
